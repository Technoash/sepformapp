# PerForm

## Todo

### bugs
- date field value is sometimes null. the create submission route doesn't like that
- comment field doesn't reset

### big stuff
- ~~submit submission~~
- ~~save and edit submission~~
- ~~view submission~~
- ~~submission comment sidebar~~
- notifications
- homepage list colours
- ~~homepage lists~~
- ~~other field types~~


### tidy up
- ~~loading animations~~ ("please be patient" notification)
- consolidate error objects
- split up into modules and files


## Moved to second release
not enough time to do all of this

- Manager to manager messages (comments offer similar functionality)
- login rate limit 
- delete forms
- delete submissions
- delete fields
- delete comments
- delete accounts
- dynamic updates without page refresh (socketio)
- resource locking (two managers can't edit a form at once)
- preview new form
- edit form
- create account, send email
- account settings


### tidy up later
- check request auth
- consolidate fields
- go over error catches
